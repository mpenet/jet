Jet is a jetty9 **Server** and **Client** client library for clojure
(both HTTP and WebSocket).

It's a drop in server adapter replacement for RING apps, and nearly
identical client api with clj-http.

## What's in the box?

* **ring adapter** running on jetty9

* Ring extension where core.async channel as response toggle **Jetty9 Async**

* Ring extension where core.async channel as :body in response does
  **Chunked Transfers**

* **Websocket Server** with a simple yet powerful api based on core.async

* **WebSocket Client** sharing the same principles/api than the WebSocket
  server handlers

* **Asynchronous HTTP Client** with streaming support

The server part started from the code of the various
`ring-jetty9-adapters` out there.

The API is still subject to changes.

## Documentation

[codox generated documentation](http://mpenet.github.io/jet/).

## Installation

jet is [available on Clojars](https://clojars.org/cc.qbits/jet).

Add this to your dependencies:

```clojure
[cc.qbits/jet "0.7.10"]
```

Jetty 9.3+ requires Java 8, you must either make sure you have it on
your system or you can exclude the jetty version brought in by Jet and
use a previous one (at your own risk).

## Examples

### Vanilla Ring handler

Nearly the same as any ring compliant adapter

```clojure
(use 'qbits.jet.server)

(run-jetty {:ring-handler handler :port ...})
```

### Ring Async

You can have fine control over Jetty9 Async mode using a core.async
channel as response:

```clojure
(require '[clojure.core.async :as async])

(defn async-handler [request]
  (let [ch (async/chan)]
    (async/go
      (async/<! (async/timeout 1000))
      (async/>! ch
                {:body "foo"
                 :headers {"Content-Type" "foo"}
                 :status 202}))
    ch))

(qbits.jet.server/run-jetty {:ring-handler async-handler})
```

### Server Chunked Responses

If you return a core.async channel in a ring body jetty will go into
async mode and the channel values will be streamed as chunks. If the
channel is closed the connection ends. If an error occurs or the
client disconnects the channel closes as well.

```clojure
(require '[clojure.core.async :as async])

(defn handler
  [request]
  (let [ch (async/chan 1)]
    (async/go
     (dotimes [i 5]
       (async/<! (async/timeout 300))
       (async/>! ch (str i "\n")))
     (async/close! ch))
    {:body ch
     :headers {"Content-Type" "prout"}
     :status 201}))

(qbits.jet.server/run-jetty {:ring-handler handler :port ...})
```

### WebSocket


In the options the `:websocket-handler` is the root handler for all
websocket connections.

The websocket handlers receive a ring request map + 3 core.async channels
and the underlying WebSocketAdapter instance for potential advanced uses.

* `ctrl` will receive status messages such as `[::error e]` `[::close reason]`

* `in` will receive content sent by this connected client

* `out` will allow you to push content to this connected client and
  close the socket


An example with a little PING/PONG between client and server:

```clojure
(use 'qbits.jet.server)
(require '[clojure.core.async :as async])

;; Simple ping/pong server, will wait for PING, reply PONG and close connection
(run-jetty
  {:port 8013
   :join? false
   :websocket-handler
    (fn [{:keys [in out ctrl ws]
          :as opts}]
        (async/go
          (when (= "PING" (async/<! in))
            (async/>! out "PONG")
            (async/close! out))))})
```

The websocket client is used the same way

```clojure
(use 'qbits.jet.client.websocket)

;; Simple PING client to our server, sends PING, waits for PONG and
;; closes the connection
(connect! "ws://localhost:8013/"
          (fn [{:keys [in out ctrl ws]}]
            (async/go
              (async/>! out "PING")
              (when (= "PONG" (async/<! in))
                (async/close! out)))))
```

If you close the :out channel, the socket will be closed, this is true
for both client/server modes.


### HTTP Client

The API is nearly identical to clj-http and other clients for
clojure. One of the major difference is that calls to the client
return a channel that will receive the eventual response
asynchronously.  The response is then a fairly standard ring response
map, except the body, which is also a core.async channel (support for
chunked responses).

Another major difference is that Jetty enforces client reuse (browser
model).  Calls to http client functions require a "client" argument,
that can/would be shared by your app depending on context. This has a
few advantages (shared cookie/auth conf, pooling etc).
To quote the Jetty9 documentation:

> HttpClient provides an efficient, asynchronous, non-blocking
> implementation to perform HTTP requests to a server through a simple
> API that offers also blocking semantic.

> HttpClient provides easy-to-use methods such as GET(String) that
> allow to perform HTTP requests in a one-liner, but also gives the
> ability to fine tune the configuration of requests via
> newRequest(URI).

> HttpClient acts as a central configuration point for network
> parameters (such as idle timeouts) and HTTP parameters (such as
> whether to follow redirects).

> HttpClient transparently pools connections to servers, but allows
> direct control of connections for cases where this is needed.

> HttpClient also acts as a central configuration point for cookies,
> via getCookieStore().

[`qbits.jet.client.http/request`](http://mpenet.github.io/jet/qbits.jet.client.http.html#var-request) &
[`qbits.jet.client.http/client`](http://mpenet.github.io/jet/qbits.jet.client.http.html#var-client) (the former builds on the later).



```clojure
(use 'qbits.jet.client.http)
(use 'clojure.core.async)

(def cl (client))

;; returns a chan
(http/get cl "http://graph.facebook.com/zuck")
user> #<ManyToManyChannel clojure.core.async.impl.channels.ManyToManyChannel@731db933>

;; block for the response

        "x-fb-debug"
        "jkc4w5S1VN3bLddmGEU+r3F/5ANxPZXrcqq3bUXJ3n2bwZq7WB0xy+mB/CziD56wHWd2us//p2dTmRQSIiW+Yg==",

       :body
       #<ManyToManyChannel clojure.core.async.impl.channels.ManyToManyChannel@7ca698b0>}


;; get to the body
(-> (http/get cl "http://graph.facebook.com/zuck")
    <!!
    :body
    <!!)
user> "{\"id\":\"4\",\"first_name\":\"Mark\",\"gender\":\"male\",\"last_name\":\"Zuckerberg\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/www.facebook.com\\/zuck\",\"locale\":\"en_US\",\"name\":\"Mark Zuckerberg\",\"username\":\"zuck\"}"

;; autodecode the body
(-> (get cl "http://graph.facebook.com/zuck" {:as :json})
         async/<!!
         :body
         async/<!!)
user> {:id "4",
       :first_name "Mark",
       :gender "male",
       :last_name "Zuckerberg",
       :link "https://www.facebook.com/zuck",
       :locale "en_US",
       :name "Mark Zuckerberg",
       :username "zuck"}

;; POST
(post cl "http://foo.com" {:form-params {:foo "bar" :baz 1}})
```

And you can imagine (or read the api doc) how `post`, `put`, `delete`
and other methods work. It's fairly standard. All the "method"
functions are just api sugar around [`qbits.jet.client.http/request`](http://mpenet.github.io/jet/qbits.jet.client.http.html#var-request).
